# simple-logic-simulator
the simple simulator computes the outputs of circuits containing NOT, OR, and AND gates as well as D-flip-flops. Each computation is executed in one tact.
This implementation is part of an academic assignment where the API and the test script are provided by the host "gitlab.uni-hannover.de".
Clone the repository, then type ./test.bash to run the program on all circuit examples.
